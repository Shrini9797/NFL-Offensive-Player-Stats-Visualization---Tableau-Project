# NFL-Offensive-Player-Stats-Visualization---Tableau-Project
This project uses data from the NFL Offensive Player Stats dataset spanning the years 1999 to 2023 with the main aim of creating Tableau dashboards for player's performance analysis and examination.

Dataset
The dataset includes various details on the players and their performance such as Year, Player, Age, Hometown, Home State, and specific performance and skill statistics such as touchdowns (TD), receptions (Rec), fantasy points (FantPt), and many more. The dataset also includes player-specific details such as player's weight, height, college, date of birth, and NFL draft details.

Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to visualize two key aspects:

Player's performance improvement over time
Colleges producing the best players over time
Tableau Dashboards
Player's Performance Over Time
This dashboard tracks the performance of individual NFL players over time. The performance metric used is 'FantPt' ostensibly representing the fantasy points a player has earned. Each player is represented by a distinct line marking their performance progress across the years.

Colleges Producing The Best Players Over Time
This dashboard presents the average player performance per college over time, thereby reflecting the colleges that have nurtured the most proficient players consistently. The measure of performance chosen is again the 'FantPt' or fantasy points earned by players.
